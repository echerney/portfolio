      <h2 id="aboutMe">So, who am I?</h2>
      <p>Hi, I'm Erin Cherney. I'm a dancer, an observer, a writer, a squirrel enthusiast, and a web developer. I studied psychology at Clemson University and am looking to make my way into the mental health field by helping to create resources, reliably keep track of data and make avenues for advocacy for people with mental illness. Most recently from Philadelphia, I helped to run a Balboa swing dance scene in the city, occasionally teaching, competing, and performing. </p>
      <h2 id="skills">Technical Skills</h2>
      <p>While studying at General Assembly's Web Development Intensive I have learned both front end and back end development skills, and have learned languages such as Javascript, jQuery, DOM, AJAX, and other things that will surely come in the next 8 weeks. I have also had experience designing html/css of pages, working with databases and other things that I don't really know what they are yet since we aren't done with the class.</p>
