      <h2>So, who am I?</h2>
      <p>Hi, I'm Erin Cherney. I'm a dancer, an observer, a writer, a squirrel enthusiast, and a web developer. I studied psychology at Clemson University and am looking to make my way into the mental health field by helping to create resources, reliably keep track of data and make avenues for advocacy for people with mental illness. Most recently from Philadelphia, I helped to run a Balboa swing dance scene in the city, occasionally teaching, competing, and performing. </p>
